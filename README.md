# Multimodal-Biometrics
Secure authentication system using fusion algorithm. Features of multiple biometrics are fused using deep learning techniques in order to make a robust authentication system.
Face recognition system is built using Facenet model by Google brains. The implemented paperis mentioned below. LFW dataset is used for testing the model. Face recognition is intially built seperately and tested on this dataset.
Iris recgonition system is tested on Casia dataset and IIT-Delhi dataset. Its built sepearately using deep learning  techniques. The features are extracted using the pretrained VGG-16 network and machine learning algorithms are trained on these features.
Later, both the features, i.e., of face and iris, are fused after which the machine learning algorithms are used.
